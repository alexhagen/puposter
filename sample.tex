            \begin{itemize}
                \item Threshold Energy Neutron Analysis uses a $2.45\,MeV$ $\left( D,D\right)$ neutron source to induce fissions in HEU cargo
                \item The CTMFD is able to discriminate out the neutrons below $~2.8\,MeV$ to show only neutrons produced from fission.
                \item Differing sizes of CTMFD have been tested from $3\,cm^{3}$ to $40\,cm^{3}$
                \item The best rejection attained was $10^{4}:1$ with a $40\,cm^{3}$ bulb with $4$ efficiency
            \end{itemize}
